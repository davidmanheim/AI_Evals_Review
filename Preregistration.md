Note: As an adapted best practice, we are filling out a copy of the "PROSPERO" Systematic review preregistration. Because that system is exclusive to medical and similar systematic reviews, this is being done separately.

Review title

Only studies which were reviews or compilation of best practices will be included.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
====================

Condition or domain being studied
---------------------------------

Overview, criticisms, best practices, and similar studies of Evaluations of AI / LLM systems.

Context
-------

We exclude papers presenting a new evaluation.

OUTCOMES TO BE ANALYSED
=======================

Main outcomes
-------------

Best Practices which are listed.

Additional outcomes
-------------------

Items needed for the practice, Domain, Type(s) of AI system included

DATA COLLECTION PROCESS
=======================

Data extraction (selection and coding)
--------------------------------------

All reviews with lists of best practices will be selected. This will be done by at least one reviewer, initially screened based on title, then checked based on the abstract and/or full text to confirm relevance.
For selecteded papers, the list of recommendations will be extracted and categorized. (They may be rphrased or generalized.)

Risk of bias (quality) assessment
---------------------------------
At least two reviewers will review each selected paper and check that the recommendations correctly reflect what the paper suggests.

PLANNED DATA SYNTHESIS
======================

Strategy for data synthesis
---------------------------

We will compile the list of standards or proposed practices from each paper, then deduplicate and group them.Â 

Analysis of subgroups or subsets
--------------------------------

We anticipate that we will focus on items relevant to modern models, and may separate some practices which are relevant only in a narrow domain. Specifically, practices relevant only to generative AI, and practices relevant to catastrophic risk evaluation, will be separated
